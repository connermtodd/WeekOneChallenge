Given a code that was already written, I was tasked with double checking code structure, cleaning it up and ensuring that the functionality of all links and images.

First, I added ALT descriptions to all images for added accessibility. I left the descriptions for the bottom-right images blank as I viewd them as "decorative images".

I changed the footer h2 to an h4, so that the proper heading sequence was followed.

I added an ID to the search engine optimization DIV (line 29) because the link was not functioning on click.

I added some spacing throughout the code's structure to make it more organized and user friendly.

There was an unnecessary </IMG> in line 69 that I removed.

Lastly, I changed the title of the page to match the name of the company.
